|Abstract | Our main question is about whether there is a relationship between countries’ and communities’ household usage of unclean fuels and air pollution, as well as rates of mortality related to such pollution. This question is important because it can help us understand how to empower communities to improve the air they breathe everyday. To address the question, we will explore datasets from the World Health Organization which show levels of household clean fuel usage, air pollution, and air pollution-related deaths in countries around the world. |
|Keywords | air pollution, clean fuel, unclean fuel, pollution-related deaths |
|Introduction | This project aims to use World Health Organization data to determine if there are any correlations between the prevalence (or lack thereof) of clean fuels in households and the air pollution in communities. We also hope to see how these levels of air pollution correlate to deaths due to ambient air pollution. Each of our three datasets (on air pollution levels, household reliance on clean fuels, and ambient air pollution-related mortality levels) have data for 2019 for a number of countries. The air pollution and clean fuel datasets also break down the data by type of community (urban versus rural) which can help us further understand fuel consumption patterns and air quality-related issues at a more specific level. The dataset on pollution-attributable deaths also breaks down deaths by specific health issue (e.g.. heart disease, respiratory infection); this can be useful to see if there are relationships between pollution levels and specific kinds of illness. |
|Problem Domain | ***Project Framing:*** Our project will consist of many variables that can be framed into the following points for an effective strategy analysis for our project plan. The domain of the project is to determine the correlation between the prevalence of having clean fuel or not in worldwide communities, the air pollution levels they live with, and the correlation of this information to deaths by air pollution. This issue can be correlated to many different elements such as socioeconomic class, where data is consistent with the pattern that areas of lower socioeconomic classes have a correlation with higher air pollution levels, and government type– socialist countries such as Venezuela, China, and North Korea are consistent with higher levels of pollution due to the nature of their system centralized around government, such as the large factories that have little to no health standards where profits go to government spending rather than citizen wellbeing. We will collect the data from the World Health Organization, create a data set, implement code in our data set to source correlations and manipulate the data that answers our questions about correlation in air pollution. ***Human Values:*** Our project has many human values associated with our research and its results. One of the main values is empathy. According to the WHO, “almost 3 billion of the world’s poorest people still rely on solid fuels… resulting in some 4 million premature deaths annually among children and adults” (“Household Fuel Consumption Guidelines”). Empathy is associated with our research because this project is to inspire change among world communities who may live in high air pollution areas that affect their daily lives and health, such as children who spend time outside receive long term health effects causing a lower life expectancy and quality of life. Other values are inspiring change among governments to implement cleaner fuel options among homes or transportation. Values that may have tensions are those who are more traditional when it comes to farming for instance, livestock and meat production is one of the largest air pollutants, but is required for food in local communities and as well a wide scale preference to eat meats as well as, most equipment is diesel based and clean fuel options are very expensive and infeasible when it comes to large farm equipment. ***Direct  & Indirect Stakeholders:*** Issues of pollution are worldwide and impact many people; according to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, “residential cooking, domestic heating, and lamps account for more than half of global anthropogenic black carbon emissions, a major component of fine particulate matter” (“Household Energy”). These kinds of pollutants lead to “ cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and reproductive, neurological, and immune system disorders” according to the National Institute of Health (“Air Pollution and Your Health”. The direct stakeholders of our data are the governments and large companies that are able to provide and mandate clean fuel for communities that have a correlation with regular fuel and air pollution. The indirect stakeholders are the people, wildlife and even the nature that are in these communities that will benefit from the change in fuel from the data we present. ***Possible Harms:*** Our project is important for human well being because it will help determine the correlation between air pollution levels and the quality of fuels in a country that runs clean fuel or a country that runs regular fuel in their communities. If interventions are taken with the data and technologies the effects of traditional energy methods with unclean fuel such as, use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers as well as the leaking of chemicals from mines, industrial plants, vehicles and landfills that produces air pollution will continue and causes a  risk for all-cause mortality as well as specific diseases. Outcomes most strongly linked with exposure to air pollution include stroke, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pneumonia, and cataract (household air pollution only). ***Benefits:***  The benefits in removing interventions along with the data and technology are very limited and mostly cost effective. This will mostly benefit large oil, mining, and other resource monopolies that do not have to change their production methods into a more expensive one, as well as companies that produce oil will only produce a quarter of what they produce now with cleaner fuel. This will only benefit their businesses. |
|Research Questions | ***Question 1: Is there a relationship between the use of non-clean fuels in households and ambient air pollution and pollution-related deaths in communities?*** This is an important question because its answer can help people understand the factors that lead to bad air quality. If there are causal factors that people contribute too on a domestic level, action can be taken to eliminate, or at least lessen, these behaviors. ***Question 2: Is there a relationship between the use of unclean fuels in households and certain illnesses?*** This is important because it can help communities understand if they can make changes in their energy systems to prevent certain illnesses that residents are more prone to. It also can help determine if there are risk factors present in a community that residents can take preventive measures against, especially if changes in household energy usage cannot be made quickly. ***Question 3: Is there a prevalence for the use of unclean fuels in specific kinds of areas (ie. rural vs urban)?*** Understanding the usage patterns of clean versus unclean fuels in different communities can help governments figure out which kinds of places they should invest more into bringing clean energy to. It can be useful if those in power can recognize patterns to create a standard process to be applied in communities of a certain kind to streamline the adoption of clean energy systems. |
|The Dataset | ***(1):***  Our problem domain with our dataset is primarily designed to examine the prevalence of communities worldwide having clean fuels, the level of air pollution they live in, and the correlation between this information and deaths caused by air pollution. With our dataset, we were able to obtain information about the extent of use of clean fuels in different regions, and their associated air quality. By comparing these three different data sets we can conclude if an area uses less clean fuels or has poorer air quality. ***(2):*** The data table is provided below. ***(3) Citations:*** World Health Organization.

These particles can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract and therefore pose a health risk by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and certain cardiovascular diseases. All of the above data are collected continuously every 2-3 years and are in the process of being updated. ***(4b):*** WHO gets its funding from two main sources: Member States paying their assessed contributions (countries’ membership dues), and voluntary contributions from Member States and other partners.

Its data repository of health-related statistics for its 194 member countries provides access to more than 1,000 indicators on priority health topics. ***(4d):*** We obtained these data through the official website of the World Health Organization, so we believe they are reliable and credible.|
|Expected Implications | If there is a relationship between non-clean fuel use in households and ambient air pollution and pollution-related deaths in the community. The first policymakers would subsidize areas where clean fuels are not used, for example, by providing funds to reduce ambient air pollution and indirect mortality. Knowing the relationship between the use of unclean fuels in the home and certain diseases, medical technologists would focus more on reducing the increase in mortality, perhaps by creating targeted drugs to combat the diseases caused by air pollution. Suppose the use of unclean fuels is every day in certain types of areas (i.e., rural and urban). In that case, the potential reason may be that clean fuels require higher levels of consumption, and designers will make products related to clean fuels more cost-effective and affordable to those who do not have access to them. Our data will compare urban and rural air quality to draw further valid conclusions. |
|Limitations | Limitations to our data that will need to be addressed is the data may not be able to cover every single community that deals with unclean fuels or those running on clean fuels. It also does not take into account each type of air pollutant and its source. Some data may not be representative of the actual air quality of a certain area as some large air pollutants are nature based such as wildfires and volcanic eruptions. Other limitations include the rate of effect on theoretical cleaner fuel substitutes in the ambient air, only the correlation between communities that run on clean fuel and those who don't. Other limitations are the actual ambient air inside households or buildings vs the outside air that may provide more detail to correlation between communities that have a difference between hours spent outside, indoor air quality, and health effects related to indoor vs outdoor air quality. |
