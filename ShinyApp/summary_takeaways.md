> **Which regions of the world suffer from the worst air Pollution?**

> Pollution Levels Around the World: PM2.5 pollution levels are higher in Asia, followed by Africa. North America has lower pollution levels compared to other continents. Interestingly, these trends remain the same for both rural and urban areas around the globe.

> **Is there a relationship between the use of unclean fuels in households and certain illnesses?**

> Household Clean Fuel Usage and Deaths From Air-Pollution Related Causes: On the whole, these two seem fairly uncorrelated, but when looking specifically at lower respiratory diseases, there seems to be a slight negative correlation between reliance on clean fuels in the household and deaths from these infections.

> **Is there a prevalence for the use of unclean fuels in specific kinds of areas (rural vs urban)?**

> Clean Fuel Usage in Rural and Urban Areas: On average in every region, people in urban areas have a higher reliance on clean fuels in the home than those in rural areas. In most regions, urban areas on average have a reliance on clean fuels of over 70%, but in Africa, this is much lower at 35%.
