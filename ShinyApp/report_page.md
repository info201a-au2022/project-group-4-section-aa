> ### ***Abstract:***
Our main question is about whether there is a relationship between countries’ and communities’ household usage of unclean fuels and air pollution, as well as rates of mortality related to such pollution. This question is important because it can help us understand how to empower communities to improve the air they breathe everyday. To address the question, we will explore datasets from the World Health Organization which show levels of household clean fuel usage, air pollution, and air pollution-related deaths in countries around the world.

> ### ***Introduction:***
This project aims to use World Health Organization data to determine if there are any correlations between the prevalence (or lack thereof) of clean fuels in households and the air pollution in communities. We also hope to see how these levels of air pollution correlate to deaths due to ambient air pollution. Each of our three datasets (on air pollution levels, household reliance on clean fuels, and ambient air pollution-related mortality levels) have data for 2019 for a number of countries. The air pollution and clean fuel datasets also break down the data by type of community (urban versus rural) which can help us further understand fuel consumption patterns and air quality-related issues at a more specific level. The dataset on pollution-attributable deaths also breaks down deaths by specific health issue (eg. heart disease, respiratory infection); this can be useful to see if there are relationships between pollution levels and specific kinds of illness.

> ### ***Problem Domain:***
> #### ***Project Framing:***
Our project will consist of many variables that can be framed into the following points for an effective strategy analysis for our project plan. The domain of the project is to determine the correlation between the prevalence of having clean fuel or not in worldwide communities, the air pollution levels they live with, and the correlation of this information to deaths by air pollution. This issue can be correlated to many different elements such as socioeconomic class, where data is consistent with the pattern that areas of lower socioeconomic classes have a correlation with higher air pollution levels, and government type– socialist countries such as Venezuela, China, and North Korea are consistent with higher levels of pollution due to the nature of their system centralized around government, such as the large factories that have little to no health standards where profits go to government spending rather than citizen wellbeing. We will collect the data from the World Health Organization, create a data set, implement code in our data set to source correlations and manipulate the data that answers our questions about correlation in air pollution.
> #### ***Human Values:***
Our project has many human values associated with our research and its results. One of the main values is empathy. According to the WHO, “almost 3 billion of the world’s poorest people still rely on solid fuels… resulting in some 4 million premature deaths annually among children and adults” (“Household Fuel Consumption Guidelines”). Empathy is associated with our research because this project is to inspire change among world communities who may live in high air pollution areas that affect their daily lives and health, such as children who spend time outside receive long term health effects causing a lower life expectancy and quality of life. Other values are inspiring change among governments to implement cleaner fuel options among homes or transportation. Values that may have tensions are those who are more traditional when it comes to farming for instance, livestock and meat production is one of the largest air pollutants, but is required for food in local communities and as well a wide scale preference to eat meats as well as, most equipment is diesel based and clean fuel options are very expensive and infeasible when it comes to large farm equipment.
> #### ***Direct  & Indirect Stakeholders :***
Issues of pollution are worldwide and impact many people; according to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, “residential cooking, domestic heating, and lamps account for more than half of global anthropogenic black carbon emissions, a major component of fine particulate matter” (“Household Energy”). These kinds of pollutants lead to “ cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and reproductive, neurological, and immune system disorders” according to the National Institute of Health (“Air Pollution and Your Health”. The direct stakeholders of our data are the governments and large companies that are able to provide and mandate clean fuel for communities that have a correlation with regular fuel and air pollution. The indirect stakeholders are the people, wildlife and even the nature that are in these communities that will benefit from the change in fuel from the data we present.
> #### ***Possible Harms:***
Our project is important for human well being because it will help determine the correlation between air pollution levels and the quality of fuels in a country that runs clean fuel or a country that runs regular fuel in their communities. If interventions are taken with the data and technologies the effects of traditional energy methods with unclean fuel such as, use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers as well as the leaking of chemicals from mines, industrial plants, vehicles and landfills that produces air pollution will continue and causes a  risk for all-cause mortality as well as specific diseases. Outcomes most strongly linked with exposure to air pollution include stroke, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pneumonia, and cataract (household air pollution only).
> #### ***Benefits:***
The benefits in removing interventions along with the data and technology are very limited and mostly cost effective. This will mostly benefit large oil, mining, and other resource monopolies that do not have to change their production methods into a more expensive one, as well as companies that produce oil will only produce a quarter of what they produce now with cleaner fuel. This will only benefit their businesses.

> ### ***Research Questions:***
> #### ***Question 1:***  Which regions of the world suffer from the worst air pollution?
This is a key question because it can highlight the areas of the world where it is most important to understand the factors that lead to bad air quality. If there are causal factors that people contribute too on a domestic level, action can be taken to eliminate, or at least lessen, these behaviors.
> #### ***Question 2:*** Is there a relationship between the use of unclean fuels in households and certain illnesses?
This is important because it can help communities understand if they can make changes in their energy systems to prevent certain illnesses that residents are more prone to. It also can help determine if there are risk factors present in a community that residents can take preventive measures against, especially if changes in household energy usage cannot be made quickly.
> #### ***Question 3:*** Is there a prevalence for the use of unclean fuels in specific kinds of areas (ie. rural vs urban)?
Understanding the usage patterns of clean versus unclean fuels in different communities can help governments figure out which kinds of places they should invest more into bringing clean energy to. It can be useful if those in power can recognize patterns to create a standard process to be applied in communities of a certain kind to streamline the adoption of clean energy systems.

> ### ***The Dataset:***
> #### ***(1)***
Our problem domain with our dataset is primarily designed to examine the prevalence of communities worldwide having clean fuels, the level of air pollution they live in, and the correlation between this information and deaths caused by air pollution. With our dataset, we were able to obtain information about the extent of use of clean fuels in different regions, and their associated air quality. By comparing these three different data sets we can conclude if an area uses less clean fuels or has poorer air quality.

All three data were collected from the World Health Organization (WHO)." Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution" (1) This data was collected to assess the burden of disease due to exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from the use of polluting fuels for cooking in different regions." Household air pollution data" (2) The main purpose of collecting this data is to compare the increase in mortality from acute lower respiratory, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, ischemic heart disease, and lung cancer associated with household use of solid fuels and kerosene in different regions." Concentrations of fine particulate matter" (3) The main purpose of this data is to look at air pollutants in different areas, as well as other particulate matter. These particles can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract and therefore pose a health risk by increasing mortality from respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer, and certain cardiovascular diseases. All of the above data are collected continuously every 2-3 years and are in the process of being updated.

The data provided by the World Health Organization is reliable, as it is the specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health, with 6 regional offices and 150 field offices worldwide. Its data repository of health-related statistics for its 194 member countries provides access to more than 1,000 indicators on priority health topics.
> #### ***(4d):***
We obtained these data through the official website of the World Health Organization, so we believe they are reliable and credible.

> ### ***Findings:***
With regard to our first research question, we saw that Asia had the highest levels of air pollution, followed by Africa. Our interactive map made this easy to visualize, with the stark difference in color from dark blue for areas of low pollution to the bright red of areas with high pollution. It also allowed for looking at pollution in rural versus urban areas, and the same areas saw the worst pollution in both cases. While our research in this project focused on household clean fuel research, the data visualized in the map is not specific to households. However, household fuels contribute heavily to pollution, as highlighted in sources mentioned above.

> For our second question, we found that there is little to no correlation overall between household clean fuel usage and air-pollution attributable deaths. The scatterplot for this relationship between clean fuel usage and total deaths attributable to air pollution does not show a clear relationship.  When isolating specific kinds of illness, this seems to hold true, but there is one exception. With lower respiratory infections, the scatterplot shows a clearer inverse relationship between the two: lower clean fuel reliance is correlated with higher death rates from these infections.  

> For our last question, our interactive bar chart shows that clean fuel reliance was higher on average in urban than rural areas in every region of the world. It also showed that the Eastern Mediterranean, European, and American regions had the highest levels of clean fuel reliance in households. When comparing these areas to the interactive map, we can see that these areas have lower overall pollution levels. Also, the chart shows that Africa has significantly lower average clean fuel usage in households in both rural and urban areas when compared to other regions of the world. While the others have rural clean fuel relances of at least 50% and at least 70% in urban areas, Africa on average sees about a 14% reliance in rural areas and a 36% reliance in urban areas. These significantly lower numbers are interesting to see in relation to the interactive map, which shows Africa as one of the areas of the world that suffers from the worst air pollution. Given the previously cited sources that say that households contribute largely to emissions, it is not surprising that an area with relatively low clean fuel reliance in households has higher air pollution levels.

> Of course, in all these findings, it’s important to note that population also plays a big role, as areas with more people are more likely to have more pollutants in the air.

> ### ***Discussion:***
All of these findings are important, as they can help people become aware of issues that affect people around the globe and their quality of life. In order to work towards solving the problem of poor air quality and high air pollution around the globe, we need to understand what factors contribute to these issues, and where the issues are most prevalent. As we can see from our findings regarding our research questions, Africa and Asia appear to be  the places that suffer the most from high levels of pollutants in their air. We further can see that world regions such as Africa, which have a lower average reliance on clean fuels in households, tend to suffer from the worst air pollution. In addition, we can see that across the globe, people in rural areas tend to rely less on clean fuels compared to their urban counterparts. While correlation is not always causation, this relationship is clear enough that it should not be ignored. Even if household fuels are not the main cause of pollution, it certainly cannot be disadvantageous to convert more households to the use of clean fuels that do less to hurt air quality in communities.

> The finding of a correlation between low household clean fuel reliance and increased death rates from lower respiratory infections attributed to air pollution highlights the direct impact that air pollution has on the health of people. Poor air pollution is not merely an annoyance; it can kill. Those with access to more clean fuels then put themselves and their communities at less risk of these preventable deaths. This might seem like an obvious problem, but visualization helps make it tangible, and perhaps even more actionable, since those who are privileged enough to not be touched by these impacts can be made aware of them. People who have access to this data can use it to push for solutions in these areas. Governments, local leaders, and communities can push for and collaborate on creating systems that rely on clean fuels so that people can enjoy better air quality and reduced-pollution related effects. This can especially be done in rural areas, as well as the areas around the world that suffer the worst pollution and have low levels of clean fuel reliance. It is important for people to see that things as simple as the fuel we use to cook can have impacts on the health of ourselves and our communities.

> ### ***Conclusion:***
> We hope that those who come into contact with our app and its visualizations come to realize the importance of clean fuels on the health of communities around the world. We hope to highlight the correlation between higher reliance on clean fuels in households and decreased air pollution. We also hope that people see that air pollution can kill from a variety of attributable diseases, and that death from lower respiratory infections appear to be less frequent where there is more of a higher reliance on clean fuels in households. Those most impacted by these impacts appear to be in Asia and Africa, and rural areas around the world appear to have less access to clean fuels for use in the home.

> Anyone who attends the University of Washington in recent years has felt the brief but painful impact of smoke from wildfires in the early fall. We all worry about getting harmful things into our lungs and being sick as a result. This difficulty only lasts for us around a week or two a year, and then we can happily forget about it. Many around the world, however, face similar potential and realized effects of air pollutants, but are not lucky enough to have these be unique to a certain time of year. This is because the pollution in their communities is not from occasional wildfires, but in large part from everyday fuel use, not just by big companies, but by households. The good news is that there is something that can be done about this, by implementing systems for the usage of clean fuels in households. This can help reduce the level of pollutants that are released into the air, and thus decrease the frequency of deaths from certain illnesses, such as lower respiratory infections. This is not something that can be done overnight, however. It requires collaboration and organization spearheaded by people who care about the cause. This does not have to be strictly carried out by people directly affected by these effects, and in fact should not be. People with greater privilege in this area should connect with, rally for, and assist communities that need better access to clean fuel in their homes. In addition, those who are able can help their own communities, no matter where they are, by using more clean fuels in their own homes. We should not underestimate the power that individuals have in improving the wellbeing of our communities.
